  dialogue:
  - This is a flickering old fireplace, its flames dancing with an ancient wisdom.
  - '"Another weary soul seeking solace in my warmth. What brings you to my hearth,
    traveler?"'
  - I seek answers. Can you shed light on the mysteries of me and this house?
  - '"Answers lie not only in questions but also in the corners often overlooked.
    Look within, young one."'
  - I investigate the fireplace and discovers a hidden corner where a piece of newspaper
    is hiding in.
  - Wait, what's this? A piece of newspaper?
  responses:
  - responseText: Pick up the fragment.
